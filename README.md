## Overview

The LRF-500 Logistic Robot Fleet is an innovative robotics project designed for efficient and adaptive logistics operations. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, the LRF-500 features an advanced path planning system, utilizing the D* Lite algorithm as its global planner and the Elastic Band algorithm as its local planner. The integration of RLidar A1 and Intel RealSense T265 enhances its navigation capabilities, making it a versatile solution for various environments.

## Features

- **Adaptive Path Planning:** The LRF-500 employs the D* Lite algorithm for global path planning, ensuring efficient and dynamic route optimization based on real-time conditions.

- **Local Navigation with Elastic Band Algorithm:** The local planner utilizes the Elastic Band algorithm, enabling the robot fleet to handle intricate and dynamic environments, adjusting its path on the fly.

- **Object Detection for Obstacle Avoidance:** The LRF-500 is equipped with advanced object detection capabilities to identify obstacles in its path. This feature enhances the fleet's ability to navigate in dynamic environments, allowing it to avoid obstacles autonomously.

- **Sensor Fusion for Robust Navigation:**
  - **RLidar A1:** The robot fleet is equipped with RLidar A1, providing reliable 360-degree laser scanning for obstacle detection and mapping.
  - **Intel RealSense T265:** Incorporating Intel RealSense T265 for visual odometry, the LRF-500 enhances its navigation accuracy and robustness in diverse scenarios.

- **Human Following Feature:** The LRF-500 includes a human-following feature, allowing the robots to autonomously follow a designated human user. This feature enhances the fleet's usability in collaborative environments.

- **Lifter Module:** Each robot in the fleet is equipped with a lifter module mounted on top of its base. This lifter module enables the robot to lift and transport objects, expanding its capabilities for various logistics tasks.

- **Control App (Under Development):** We are actively working on a dedicated control app for the LRF-500, providing users with an intuitive interface to monitor and control the robot fleet. Stay tuned for updates on the app's development.
