## Project Description
The LRF-500 logistic robot fleet is designed to automate logistics operations in warehouses and industrial settings. The robots are equipped with advanced sensors and motion planning algorithms to navigate and transport goods efficiently.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Efficient path planning using multiple algorithms
- Real-time sensor fusion
- Easy integration with existing logistics systems

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LRF-500.git
   cd LRF-500
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have ROS and Gazebo installed.
   - Install the required ROS packages:
     ```bash
     rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
     ```

3. **Build the workspace:**
   ```bash
   catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage
1. **Launch the simulation environment:**
   ```bash
   roslaunch lrf_simulation warehouse_sim.launch
   ```

2. **Run the robot control node:**
   ```bash
   rosrun lrf_control control_node
   ```

3. **Monitor the robot:**
   - Use RViz to visualize the robot's sensors and path planning:
     ```bash
     roslaunch lrf_viz rviz.launch
     ```

## Configuration
Configuration files for the robot's sensors, algorithms, and environment settings can be found in the `config` directory. Modify these files to adjust parameters as needed.

## Algorithms
The project implements several path planning algorithms, including:
- **A***: A graph-based algorithm known for its optimality and completeness.
- **Dijkstra**: A graph-based algorithm that guarantees the shortest path.
- **D* Lite**: An incremental heuristic search algorithm for dynamic environments.
- **RRT**: A sampling-based algorithm for efficient path planning.
- **RRT***: An optimized version of RRT that guarantees asymptotic optimality.
- **Informed RRT***: An enhanced version of RRT* with heuristic guidance.

## Contributing
